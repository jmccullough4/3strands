## 3 Strands Cattle Co. Dashboard

### Local sign-in

The dashboard ships with a local authentication flow. On first run an administrator account is created with the credentials `admin` / `ChangeMe123!`. Sign in with that account and visit **Manage users** to add ranch teammates, fill in their contact details, and set temporary passwords (minimum eight characters).

Encourage teammates to change their password after the first login via the avatar menu ‚ûù **Change password**.

### Running locally

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The server listens on port `8081` by default. Uploads are stored in the `uploads/` directory next to `app.py`, and the SQLite database lives under `instance/dashboard.db`.

### Updating the calendars

By default the dashboard surfaces the ranch-wide Google Calendar shared at `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y181NTQ1ZWEyMDlmMTY0YzJmZjgwMWY2Mzg1MWJmMzU4YTdmODViNjExNWQxMTYyZThhNGJjYjhkYjg0ZjM5MWRkQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20`. If you prefer a different calendar (or multiple calendars), override the `CALENDAR_EMBEDS` list in `instance/config.py` or set the `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_PRIMARY` environment variable.
